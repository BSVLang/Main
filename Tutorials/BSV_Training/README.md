# Bluespec_BSV_Tutorial
A tutorial for learning the Bluespec BSV HLHDL (High Level Hardware
Design Langauge)

BSV is a High-level Hardware Design Language (HLHDL), taking its inspirations from Haskell and Term Rewriting Systems.
An implementation of BSV (a compiler from BSV into Verilog) has been available from
Bluespec, Inc. (www.bluespec.com) since 2004, and has been used for several industrial-strength hardware designs.  Bluespec, Inc. provides free licenses for teaching and research to academia and research institutions, and commercial licenses to others.

Please start by reading the file <tt>START_HERE.pdf</tt>. Briefly:
the directory <tt>Example_Programs</tt> contains a series of example
programs starting from extremely simple ("Hello World") to fairly
complex (concurrent memory-to-memory Mergesort).  Each example has an
accompanying PDF file to explain it.  All examples can be built and
run using the <tt>Makefile</tt> in the <tt>Build</tt> directory
(provided you have an installation of the Bluespec BSV tools).

The <tt>Reference</tt> directory contains a series of PDF lectures
that explain the language syntax, semantics, libraries and idioms,
organized by topic.
